# Social Media User Analysis

This project analyzes user behavior on social media platforms using Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and scikit-learn. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, segmentation, clustering, and key insights.

## Contents

- [`Social_Media_User_Analysis.ipynb`](Social_Media_User_Analysis.ipynb): Main Jupyter Notebook with all code and visualizations.
- `social_media_usage.csv`: Dataset used for analysis (not included here for privacy).

## Features

- **EDA:** Summary statistics, group-by analysis, and descriptive statistics for each app.
- **Visualizations:** Histograms, boxplots, pie charts, and scatter plots to explore user activity.
- **Segmentation:** Users are segmented by engagement levels and patterns.
- **Clustering:** KMeans clustering to identify user groups based on activity.
- **Key Insights:** Analysis of top 10% users by minutes spent, posts, likes, and follows.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aryan999444/social-media-user-analysis.git 
   cd <repo-name>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```
3. Place your `social_media_usage.csv` file in the project directory.
4. Open `Social_Media_User_Analysis.ipynb` in VS Code or Jupyter Notebook and run the cells.

## Example Visualizations

- Distribution of daily minutes spent, posts, likes, and follows.
- Boxplot of minutes spent per app.
- Pie chart of app usage distribution.
- Scatter plot of minutes spent vs. follows per day.
- Clustering visualization of user groups.
